            <h2>About TRAPPIST-1f</h2>
            <p>TRAPPIST-1f is one of seven planets orbiting the ultra-cool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1. It's a rocky planet with the potential to be habitable.</p>
            <h3>Key Facts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>TRAPPIST-1f is a potentially habitable exoplanet located in the TRAPPIST-1 system, about 40 light-years away. It's a rocky planet, slightly smaller than Earth, and lies within the star's habitable zone, where conditions might allow liquid water to exist. The planet's cool temperature suggests it could support a thick atmosphere, making it a candidate for further study in the search for life beyond our solar system.
